      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;ve found a way to connect my Arch-Linux laptop to the WSU WIFI reliably. Since I had a bit of difficulty figuring this out on my own I thought I would document it here.
I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you already have wifi capability set-up, and have connected to other networks. I am using Network Manager. With the nmcli to connect to networks normally. But I found it easier to use nmtui, when dealing with networks that need a username and a password.</description>

      <title>LaTeX with Hugo and PaperMod</title>

      <description>Intro I recently set up my personal site using Hugo the static site generator, with deployment to github pages. Most of the proccess was straight-forward and enjoyable. I did run into a few problems when trying to enable support for LaTeX type syntax embedded in my markdown files. I thought I would do a short step-by-step write-up for future reference.
Most of this setup is available in the Official Hugo Documentation but there are a few pitfalls and theme specific steps that are not included there.</description>

      <description>Today I am just about finished with migrating my personal site from wordpress. I wanted to revamp the way I interact with my site, to make it easy to integrate into my workflow, and hopefully produce more documentation of what I&amp;rsquo;m up to.
I was looking for the following features in my migration: Write pages in markdown format. I like to do everything in a modal editor these days. I am currently using Helix text editor after migrating from vim.</description>
